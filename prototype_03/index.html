      <h2>Wheel of Misfortune</h2>
      <ul>

         <li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
            <br>A pesky chameleon has somehow landed on the wheel of a guessing game. Players help the
            <br>little guy out by choosing the proper color he should be when the wheel stops.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Theme:</strong></li>
         <ul><li>Guessing Game Gone Wrong</li>
            <li>Invisibility</li>
         </ul><br>

         <li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong></li>
            <ul><li>Input: Clickable Buttons</li>
               <li>Randomness: A Lot of Randomness</li>
               <li>Play styles: Joker</li>
               <li>Genres: Arcade</li>
            </ul><br>

         <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong></li>
         <ul><li>Entertainment and humor; using a variety of colors to envoke fun and amusement.</li>
            <li>Likeable maiin character; hopefully players develop a sense of attachment to the
               <br>star chameleon and root for his succeess.</li>
         </ul><br>

         <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
            <br>The wheel will contineously spin and repeatedly stop at a certain color, the player then
            <br>has a limited amount of time to change the chameleons color by clicking on one of the
            <br>on-screen buttons.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
            <br>This prototype took a step back from exploring new Phaser features and instead focused on
            <br>refining or further developing skills aquired. Features present in this prototype include:
            <ul><li>More practice with animation and using specific frames for specific cases.</li>
               <li>On-screen buttons and small interface/world design.</li>
               <li>Working with Phaser Timer and Event functions and understanding when they are useful.</li>
            </ul>
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Features:</strong>
            <br>The game is mostly a point-and-click interactive puzzle/arcade game. Most of the games elements
            <br>are lighthearted and more effort was spent on desinging the premise in a unique and hopefuilly
            <br>entertaining way.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
            <br>The game is set on a game show stage when some technical difficulty has occured: a chameleon
            <br>has somehow managed to climb onto the games spinning wheel.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Story:</strong>
            <br>The story begins with a chameleon having managed to climb its way onto a game shows wheel, there
            <br>it continues to change color depending on its background to camouflage itself from the audience.
            <br>The story concludes with the chameleon being discovered.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
            <br>This game is suitable for all ages and all demographics. Those with color blindness might have
            <br>a difficult time telling the colors apart.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
            <br>This game is an arcade game and may take between seconds to minutes in gameplay.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
            <br>Players have 2 seconds to click on the matching wheel color on the left interface, so a good
            <br>strategy would be to keep their mouse within that range.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
            <br>All the image assets, except for the chameleon, where self-made. The link for the original
            <br>un-edited chameleon sprite is listed:

            </ul>
            The audio assets were collected from:
