      <h2>Crash</h2>
      <ul>

         <li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
            <br>Players race against two computer-controlled cars, however they must abide by the rules of the road;
            <br>making sure to observe the stoplight or risk crashing into another car.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Theme:</strong></li>
         <ul><li>Car accident</li>
         </ul><br>

         <li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong></li>
            <ul><li>Input: Clickable Buttons</li>
               <li>Randomness: Some Randomness</li>
               <li>Play styles: -- </li>
               <li>Genres: Racer</li>
            </ul><br>

         <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong></li>
         <ul><li>Experience a 2D fast-paced racer; where players control their own vehicles.</li>
            <li>Suspense and risk; players must make quick decisions on how to drive and whether they risk themselves.</li>
            <li>Scoreboarding and oppurtunity to score better on subsequent trials.</li>
         </ul><br>

         <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
            <br>Players race against two computer-controlled cars and must survive a chosen number of laps by following the
            <br>rules or risking themselves. As players lap through, a stoplight will call a specific signal color: green, yellow,
            <br>red at each lap. The breakdown of the signals is as follows:
            <br><ul><li>Green: Players may pass without fear of crashing.</li>
               <li>Red: Players must stop or they will crash.</li>
               <li>Yellow: Players have the option to pass onto the next block or stop, but there is a 50/50 chance of crashing.</li>
            </ul>
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
            <ul><li>To iterate and further polish a designed prototype from physical to digital</li>
            </ul>
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Features:</strong>
            <br>All efforts in this iteration was spent polishing the aesthetics, cleaning up bugs, and adding new features.
            <br>See "Prototype Closest Other Game" for further details.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
            <br>The setting is suburban for this prototype.
            <br>The initial premise for the game was that of a street, rather than professional, type race.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Story:</strong>
            <br>Prototype has no story other than the race itself.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
            <br>This game is suitable for all ages, although some might feel it needs parental guidance regarding the car crashes.
            <br>Futhermore, this game might be interesting for gamers who enjoy racer games.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
            <br>A single race often takes upwards of 5 minutes, but can be shorter or longer than that. Lap options range from
            <br>5 to endless mode; therefore the game can take as little as 1 minute to infinitely long.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
            <br>Opponent cars start immediately and there is no lag time with their driving, so players must be quick about starting
            <br>their vehicle when stopped, since there is slight a acceleration lag. Players who play the game enough notice
            <br>incoming cars faster and can then hit the brake faster.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
         </li>Updates in this version include:
         <ul><li>Fixed bugs with computer controlled opponent cars. Cars are less prone to stopping in the middle of the intersection.</li>
            <li>Polished environment by adding trees and bushes to the roads.</li>
            <li>Incoming cars now come in a number of colors to add variety to the game.</li>
