      <h2>Crash</h2>
      <ul>

         <li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
            <br>Players race against two computer-controlled cars, however they must abide by the rules of the road;
            <br>making sure to observe the stoplight or risk crashing into another car.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Theme:</strong></li>
         <ul><li>Car accident</li>
         </ul><br>

         <li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong></li>
            <ul><li>Input: Clickable Buttons</li>
               <li>Randomness: Some Randomness</li>
               <li>Play styles: -- </li>
               <li>Genres: Racer</li>
            </ul><br>

         <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong></li>
         <ul><li>Experience a 2D fast-paced racer; where players control (albiet limitedly) their own vehicles.</li>
            <li>Suspense and risk; players must make quick decisions on how to drive and whether they risk themselves.</li>
            <li>Scoreboarding and oppurtunity to score better on subsequent trials.</li>
         </ul><br>

         <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
            <br>Players race against two computer-controlled cars and must survive a 10 lap race by following the rules or
            <br>risking themselves. As players lap through, a stoplight will call a specific signal color: green, yellow, red
            <br>at each lap. The breakdown of the signals is as follows:
            <br><ul><li>Green: Players may pass without fear of crashing.</li>
               <li>Red: Players must stop or they will crash.</li>
               <li>Yellow: Players have the option to pass onto the next block or stop, but there is a 50/50 chance of crashing.</li>
            </ul>
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
            <ul><li>To develop a digital game based off mechanics of a physical prototype.</li>
               <li>To combine skills learned from all prototypes into a single product.</li>
            </ul>
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Features:</strong>
            <br>This prototype uses various assets for visual appeal, but ultimately was more code-intensive than previous protypes.
            <br>Most of the development time was spent on features such as driving, opponent AI, crashing rate, lap wrapping...etc.
            <br>There are a few bugs and kinks to work put with regards to opponent AI and their driving/stopping mechanics. There
            <br>is also room for more player options such as car color, number of laps, and types of races, that will be tested in
            <br>future iterations.
            <br>NOTE: the restart button has been added but not yet implemented.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
            <br>The setting is potentially suburban for this prototype, but future iterations might move it to urban areas.
            <br>The initial premise for the game was that of a street, rather than professional, type race.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Story:</strong>
            <br>Prototype has no story other than the race itself.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
            <br>This game is suitable for all ages, although some might feel it needs parental guidance regarding the car crashes.
            <br>Futhermore, this game might be interesting for gamers who enjoy racer games.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
            <br>A single race often takes upwards of 5 minutes, but can be shorter or longer than that. Future iterations will
            <br>add a "number of laps" option for players to either increase or decrease playtime.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
            <br>Opponent cars start immediately and there is no lag time with their driving, so players must be quick about starting
            <br>their vehicle when stopped, since there is slight a acceleration lag. Players who play the game enough notice
            <br>incoming cars faster and can then hit the brake faster.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
            <br>The full list of borrowed and modified assets include:
            <ul>
               <li><a href="https://openclipart.org/user-detail/isaiah658">Car Model</a></li>
               <li><a href="http://www.opengameart.org">Grass Tile</a></li>
               <li><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/499688521140257242/">Road Tile</a></li>
               <li><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/atarikid0042/fx/">Explosion Animation</a></li>
               <li><a href="http://www.stockunlimited.com/vector/brake-pedal-and-accelerator_1358958.html">Accelerate/Brake Buttons</a></li>
               <li><a href="http://www.freesound.org">All audio assets</a></li>
            </ul>
               <br>

         <li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
         </li><br>Prototype takes the main mechanic (crash scenarios and light signal) from the physical prototype. Rather than
               <br>make the game turn-based, the mechanics are now in real-time. The physical game was also playable by 2 - 3 people,
               <br>however the digital version is a single player game with AI cars replacing other players.
