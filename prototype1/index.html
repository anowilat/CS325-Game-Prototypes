      <h2>The Good, the Bad, and the Asteroid</h2>
      <ul>

         <li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
            <br>With the aid of very large man-made horseshoes, players battle an oncoming onslaught of
            <br>asteroids and meteors headed towards Earth.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Theme:</strong></li>
         <ul><li>Cowboys</li>
            <li>Asteroid heading towards Earth</li>
         </ul><br>

         <li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
            <br>The genre of the game is sci-fi arcade, with no objectives in the game aside from
            <br>accumulating a higher score with each playthrough. The asteroids and meteors spawn at
            <br>random, therefore there is no fixed technique to the game and players must rely on reflexes.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong></li>
         <ul><li>Simple arcade gameplay; the game tests player reflexes instead of strategy or logic in
               <br>a simple arcade-like format.</li>
            <li>Acculumating score points; the ultimate goal of the player is to score as high as they
               <br>can before losing the game.</li>
            <li>Given the format of the game and the types of elements used (horseshoes), a small
               <br>comedic effort was made to entertain or potentially humor the player.
            </li>
         </ul><br>

         <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
            <br>Players use a point-and-click interface using the mouse pointer to fling horseshoes in the
            <br>direction of the asteroids. Players gains +5 points for every asteroid hit, additionally,
            <br>players start off with 3 health points and lose a health point each time they are hit by
            <br>an asteroid.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
            <br>This prototype is a beginners effort at Phaser and Javascript, and the mechanics tested
               <br>include:
                     <ul>
                        <li>Spawning sprites at random locations on the borders of the game window.</li>
                        <li>Collectively directing sprites towards a specific point in the game.</li>
                        <li>Collision and overlay mechanics.</li>
                        <li>Shooting in the direction of a pointer; taking firing rate into account.</li>
                     </ul>
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Features:</strong>
            <br>The initial premise of the game was designed in slightly B-rated movie/parody format.
            <br>No main character or other characters exist in the game, the POV is that of the Earth
            <br>in space; collectively combatting the asteroids. There is not much unique about the game
            <br>aside from the concept and the execution.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
            <br>An additional feature that was to be added to the game was a parody scene explaining how
            <br>the human world has collapsed; with society returning to the days of the Old West. Sensing
            <br>the coming asteroid apocalypse, humans fashioned a large sling to fling equally large
            <br>horseshoes into space and defend themselves from the asteroid attack.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Story:</strong>
            <br>This game does not have a story and instead focuses on the arcade gameplay mechanics.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
            <br>This game is appropriote for all ages, and does not have a specific demographic in mind.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
            <br>The length of the game depends on how long the player can outlast the asteroids, and therefore
            <br>can range from a few seconds to potentially 10 minutes or more.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
            <br>The game style and mechanics are arcade with emphesis on player hand-eye coordination. Little
            <br>strategy is needed for the game; especially with enemies spawning at random.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
            <br>All assets are not original and some were collected from the internet under a "labeled for reuse"
            <br>tag. These sources include:
