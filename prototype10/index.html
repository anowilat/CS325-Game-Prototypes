      <h2>As Seen On TV</h2>
      <ul>

         <li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
            <br>Side scrolling stealth game where players must control an anonymous individual hunted by
            <br>unknown forces meaning to steal their memories.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Theme:</strong></li>
         <ul><li>Television Is Broadcasting Actual Memories</li>
         </ul><br>

         <li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong></li>
            <ul><li>Input: Keyboard buttons</li>
               <li>Randomness: Some Randomness</li>
               <li>Play styles: -- </li>
               <li>Genres: Side-scroller, Stealth</li>
            </ul><br>

         <li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong></li>
         <ul><li>Appeal to players through aesthetic and dark themes.</li>
            <li>Provide players with an entertaining side scroller fused with stealth mechanics</li>
            <li>Instill a sense of suspense to get hero to safety.</li>
         </ul><br>

         <li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
            <br>Players control a side scrolling character using keyboard arrow input.
            <br>The goal of the game is to reach the distance required before a set amount of time; while
            <br>avoiding thugs running in the opposite direction by hiding behind crates.
            <br>Players can move up and down the alleyway using the up and down keys, and hide behind crates
            <br>by pressing the left arrow key when close enough, then pressing the right arrow key to resume
            <br>running. If players do not manage to hide before a thug gets close enough, the player is killed.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
            <ul><li>To digitally implement a physical prototype and compare the evolution of the game mechanic.</li>
            </ul>
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Features:</strong>
            <br>The gameplay mechanics of the game are simple, with the exception that the player is able to hide
            <br>and temporarily stop the scrolling mechanic. The bulk of the work was spent presenting the game
            <br>in an artistic way, and polishing was done in the way of presentation, sound, and aesthetic.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
            <br>The setting for the game is in an urban area; potentially between streets and alley ways.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Story:</strong>
            <br>An unknown individual is running from an organization which steals peoples memories to broadcast them
            <br>on television. The memories owners are never heard from again. While the individual runs from the
            <br>goons, it might be noticed that the situation is observed from a television; which brings to question
            <br>the heros survival...
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
            <br>This game is may not be suitable for all ages, but players who enjoy side scrollers or stealth might
            <br>enjoy the gameplay.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
            <br>The game should not take very long, the player can reach an end goal and win.
         </li><br>

         <li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
            <br>Gaurds footsteps can be heard a couple seconds before they appear on screen; giving players time to
            <br>properly react if a crate is nearby.
            <br>Players must pay attention to the time remaining versus the distance still left to cover. Hiding frequently
            <br>can greatly decrease the time left; especially when a gaurd is not actually incoming.
         </li><br>
